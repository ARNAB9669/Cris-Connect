                                                                              Cris-connect
This is an AI power LAN network app. This helps in the moment of natural disaster. We will create router like towers that will be covering a specific area and we will connect the next router with the old router so it increases the range. So, by this we will create a local network where it will be possible to make the app run without internet and as routers are not connected via wires and they are solar powered it has very less chance of being down. And 

this is some feature this project app will provide.

1.See local map and drop pin and text about the location.
2.So in danger time people will be see where the shelter is    where the aid is being given. Where is medical camp.
3.An AI that will keep note of everything and warns the user about the natural disasters early via sending all the important notifications early.
4.An SOS button will be provided for any danger when sos is clicked the app will send the live location and a need help massage to all connected mobiles and help team like police, relative, fire service, ambulance etc.
5.As it will run on local network no internet will be needed and it will have no lag and be Superfast.
6. We will modify the routers with own hardware and large antenna so it will cover a huge amount of land.
7. It is possible to make mini tower like router that will cover like 1km or minimum 500m.
8. This do not need any mobile or Cellular network
9. this mini towers will be solar powered in day and battery in night.
10. People wil be able to charge their phone from this towers.

What it solves.

First letâ€™s see what the problem: First of al when storm and floods etc occurs we do not get internet, no connectivity etc. And for that help gets delayed.

This is what we are solving :-
The power problem.
The connectivity problem.
The mobile network problem.
No electricity problem.
Using AI for accurate weather forecast.
Something new and I no where being used in INDIA.
